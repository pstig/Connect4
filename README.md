# Connect4
CS201 Portfolio Project

***Note this was done in 24 hours of furious coding before the deadline. It is technically functional but has a lot of issues.***


This game is based on the game Connect4. The goal of the game is to get 4 "tokens" in a row in a board. The tokens 
can be in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The goal of getting 4 in a row does not change based on board
size, even on a 100x100 board, the goal is still to get 4 in a row. 

When you first run the game it will give you the option to choose single player or two player by entering a 1 or a 2. 
The game will then ask for the number of rows and columns that you want in the board. In a normal Connect4 game, the 
board is 6x7, but the user can pick any size. The minimum size possible for a win is 4x4, and the board will distort
at a size of around 10x10. After entering the board size, the board will be generated. In two player mode, the game 
will allow the first player to start by entering the number of a column. It will then be the second player's turn. 
The game will continue in this way, with each player entering a column number to choose their move, until one player 
has gotten 4 in a row. The "tokens" used by the players are X's and O's. In single player, the user will be playing 
against the computer. The user will always go first. In the same way as two player, after the board is generated, the 
user will enter a column number to play. Then it will be the computer's turn. The game will continue like this until 
either the computer or the user has gotten 4 tokens in a row.   

Once a player has won, the game will keep track of the game score and ask if you would like to play again. 

If you would like to exit at any time hit ctrl + C.

If you would like to switch from 1-Player to 2-Player or vice versa, exit the game and open it again and choose the option wou would like.
